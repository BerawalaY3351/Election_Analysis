## Election Summary
The script can be expanded or modified to show information for the election. The code was modified to show Total Votes, County Votes, Largest County turnout, and winner candiate from county with the highest votes. 

Regardless of any election this script can be use in future. Two examples that can use one is election results containing 3 columns with adding fourth column for "Political party. Second one can use to understand what is the voters age. 
Example:
1. Adding fourth column "Political party"
   - Votes per political
   - Vote percentage for political party out of total votes
2. Add "Age" column
   - Which age group has the highest voters?
   - Which age group responsuble for the winner and loser of the election
   - Which age group supports the political party ?

There alot of ideas that can be implemented into the code to future election. But the examples above can give a little idea or hint what future programmers or client do with using the script given.
